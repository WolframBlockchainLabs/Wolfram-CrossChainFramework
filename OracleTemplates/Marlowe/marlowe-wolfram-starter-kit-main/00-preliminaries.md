# Preliminaries for Using Marlowe

The [demeter.run](https://demeter.run/) web3 development platform provides an extension, *Cardano Marlowe Runtime*, that has Marlowe tools installed. This extension provides the Marlowe Runtime backend services and a Cardano node, so you don't need to set environment variables, install tools or run backend services.
