# Wolfram Cross-chain Framework

Through research and experimentation, we’ve learned the importance and difficulty of bringing data on-chain. In fact, one of the main things we’ve learned is that most of the language for explaining oracles and cross-chain data is incorrect. From the perspective of any blockchain, it only knows a few things about the state of its own system because blockchain protocols are internally verified systems. They have no intrinsic way of understanding data from another blockchain or from the “real world.” Therefore, any data from outside the blockchain in question is considered “off-chain.” This distinction is important because it helps to frame the actual problem that we attempt to understand in the Wolfram Cross Chain Framework. It was our experiment to create a way for blockchains to onboard information from off chain in an economically viable, secure and efficient manner.
In this repo you will find our crosschain exploration with fungible and no fungible token import/export and also some example smart contracts of usecases where information from other chains is used for execution.
